### Round System
- Each round spawns more zombies with increased health
- **Early rounds (1-5)**: 8 zombies with manageable health
- **Mid rounds (6-10)**: More zombies, noticeably tougher
- **Late rounds (11+)**: Many zombies with very high health
- Zombie health scales exponentially - weapons become less effective over time

### Areas
The map has 4 different areas where zombies can spawn:
- **Grasslands**
- **Rocklands** 
- **Dirtlands**
- **Poshlands**

### Strategy Tips

1. **Early Game (Rounds 1-5)**:
   - Use your pistol efficiently
   - Save points for Juggernog first
   - Learn zombie movement patterns

2. **Mid Game (Rounds 6-10)**:
   - Get better weapons from Mystery Box
   - Purchase Speed Cola for faster reloads
   - Start building your perk collection

3. **Late Game (Round 11+)**:
   - Focus on high-damage weapons (AK47, Olympia)
   - Use Double Tap for maximum damage
   - Manage ammo carefully with Max Ammo powerups
   - Keep moving to avoid being surrounded

4. **General Tips**:
   - Always keep moving - standing still means death
   - Reload in safe moments between zombie waves
   - Use knife attacks to save ammo on weakened zombies
   - The Mystery Box moves locations periodically
   - Watch your stamina when sprinting

### Winning
There is no traditional "win" condition - the goal is to survive as many rounds as possible and achieve the highest score. Challenge yourself and your friends to see who can survive the longest!

## üèÜ Scoring
Your final score is based on:
- Total points earned

- Rounds survived

Good luck, survivor! üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

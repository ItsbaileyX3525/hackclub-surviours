### New System (Balanced Progression)
| Round | Health Modifier | Zombie HP | Pistol Shots to Kill | AK47 Shots to Kill |
|-------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1     | 1.00          | 4         | 4                   | 2                 |
| 5     | 2.20          | 8         | 8                   | 3                 |
| 10    | 5.00          | 20        | 20                  | 7                 |
| 11    | 5.80          | 23        | 23                  | 8                 |
| 15    | 8.53          | 34        | 34                  | 12                |
| 20    | 13.37         | 53        | 53                  | 18                |

## Key Improvements

1. **Early Game (Rounds 1-5)**: Manageable progression, weapons stay effective
2. **Mid Game (Rounds 6-10)**: Noticeable increase in difficulty 
3. **Late Game (Round 11+)**: Weapons become noticeably weak, creating need for upgrades

## Expected Gameplay Impact

- **Round 11**: Players will clearly notice weapons becoming insufficient
- **Round 15+**: Strong incentive to use weapon upgrader system (when you add it)
- **Shotgun remains viable longer** due to high damage per shot
- **AK47 becomes preferred** over pistol in mid-game due to higher damage
